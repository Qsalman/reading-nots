#What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension
The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice
series of themes. These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
—but there are other themes to choose from as well. Since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time, it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue.
# Third-Party Options
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today
