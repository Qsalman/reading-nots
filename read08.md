**LOOPS There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly**


# Comparison Operators:
### Is Equalto  ==
### Is notEqual to !=
### Strict Equal to ===
###  Strict not equal to !==
### Grater than or Equal to >= 
###  Less thatn or Equal to <=
###  Grater than > 
###  Less than <

    # Using While Loops 
    
    ### Here is an example of awhile loop. It writes out the 5 times table. Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written
    ### into the variable called msg. This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in  the parentheses is true. That condition is a counter indicating 
    ### that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run. Inside the code block there are two statements:
    ### The first statement uses the+= operator, which is used to add new content to the msg variable. Each time the loop runs, a new calculation and line break is
    ### added to the end of the message being stored in it. So+" works as a shorthand for writing: msg = msg + 'new msg' (See bottom of the next page for a breakdown of this statement.)
    ### The second statement increments the counter variable by one. (This is done inside the loop rather than with the condition.) When the loop has finished, the
    ### interpreter goes to the next line of code, which writes the msg variable to the page.
